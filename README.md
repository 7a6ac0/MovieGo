## API Key ðŸ”‘
You will need to provide developer token to fetch the data from TMDB API.
* Generate a new token (v4 auth) from [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api). Copy the token and go back to Android project.
* Create a new kotlin file `ApiKey.kt` in path `./buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/`.
* Define a constant `TMDB_API_TOKEN` with the double quotes, it looks like

```kotlin
const val TMDB_API_TOKEN = "\"eyJhbJ**************************5n-f\""
```

```kotlin
defaultConfig {
    ...
    buildConfigField("String", "TMDB_API_TOKEN", TMDB_API_TOKEN)
    ...
}
